<br />

`rscan` is a network security scanning tool written in Rust.

The goal is to build an efficient network scanner for local LAN environments with:
- host and service discovery
- packet inspection
- built-in threat detection
- terminal user interface (TUI)

This project is currently being reorganized into a crate-based architecture.

## Usage

```
usage: rscan [MODE] [OPTIONS]

Arguments:
-t, --tui           Terminal User Interface mode. (Default mode).
-p, --passive       Passive mode. (Displaying packets metadata).
-a, --active        Active mode (Host/port discovery).


Options:
-v, --verbose       Verbose output logging.
-h, --help          Print help.
-V, --version       Print version.

Notes:
If no mode is specified, --tui is assumed.
 ```

## Crates

- `core`: orchestration/runtime integration, shared models/events, config and security checks
- `capture`: packet capture and frame decode/parsing adapters
- `probe`: active discovery and probing workflow (host/port scan pipeline)
- `detect`: detection engine and rule evaluation
- `tui`: terminal UI surface and input handling
